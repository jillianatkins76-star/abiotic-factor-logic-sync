## 🛠 Project Research Modules

The latest technical build (v1.2.4) explores the following logic-core modules for Abiotic Factor research:

*   **⚡ Biological Integrity Sync:** Analysis of player damage vectors to simulate "God Mode" and radiation immunity for high-risk environmental research.
*   **🧱 Resource Allocation Mapping:** Documentation of the crafting engine to allow for "Instant Material Synthesis" (Crafting without requirements).
*   **🍕 Metabolic Decay Bypassing:** Research into the survival-stat logic to disable hunger, thirst, and fatigue cycles during long-term facility exploration.
*   **🏃 Kinetic Energy Optimization:** Logic patches for the stamina and carry-weight modules, allowing for unrestricted movement across the lab sectors.
*   **🛡️ Stealth Protocol:** An internal handshake that ensures the research module remains synchronized with standard Steam builds.
